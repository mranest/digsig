The exact algorithm\r\nused is configurable, as is the way the plaintext is constructed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the applet is running in the JRE's applet sandbox (portable\r\nacross a number of platforms), proper access to a certificate store\r\nlimits its use mainly to IE on Windows. Chrome and Opera also work, but\r\nthe certificate store accessed is Windows certificate store.\r\n\r\nFirefox does not work anymore!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with DigSig?
